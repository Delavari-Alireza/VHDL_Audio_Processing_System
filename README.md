[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This VHDL project implements an audio processing system. It takes two digital audio signals in A-Law format as input, adds them together, and converts the result to μ-Law format. The processed audio is then output on specific time-slots.

## Description

In this project, we have designed a behavioral VHDL implementation of the audio processing system. The system operates based on specific time-slots and processes audio signals bit by bit. It converts A-Law signals to linear format, adds them, and then converts the result to μ-Law format. The system is synchronized with time-slots, and data is processed and output accordingly.

## Getting Started

To use this VHDL project, you will need a VHDL development environment such as Xilinx Vivado. You can clone this repository to your local machine and open the project using your development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alireza499/VHDL_Audio_Processing_System.git
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the VHDL project in your development environment.
3. Simulate or synthesize the project to see the audio processing in action.

## Contributing
